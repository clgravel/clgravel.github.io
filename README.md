# Claude Gravel's personal GitHub page

Here are few things I research in connection with my repositories are:

- Solving large (not necessarily sparse) systems of linear equations over finite fields using probabilistic algorithms.
- In connection with solving linear systems, the following repository on [number walls](https://github.com/clgravel/number_walls) is a C++ implementation of number walls for computing determinants of Hankel / Toeplitz matrices over F<sup>2<sup>. Number walls are nicely explained (but no proof given) in *The Book of Numbers* by John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy.

- Properties of families of permutations that are extensions of non-linear small (random or pseudo-random) functions as in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219498823500512) and to some extent this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219498823500512). 

The repository on [determinants of Hankel matrices](https://github.com/clgravel/hankel_determinants_and_finding_linear_subsequences) is a bit messy coded but I will leave it this way to breathe life into the [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68869-1_10).
