# Claude Gravel's personal GitHub page

A few things I research in connection with my repositories are:

- Bla bla 1

- Bla bla 2

The repository on [determinants of Hankel matrices](https://github.com/clgravel/hankel_determinants_and_finding_linear_subsequences) is a bit messy coded but I will leave it this way to breathe life into the [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68869-1_10).
