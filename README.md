<p>Here are few things I research in connection with my repositories are:
<ul>
<li> Solving large (not necessarily sparse) systems of linear equations over finite fields using probabilistic algorithms.</li>

<ul>
<li> In connection with solving linear systems, the following repository on <a href="https://github.com/clgravel/number_walls">number walls</a> is a C++ implementation of number walls for computing determinants of Hankel / Toeplitz matrices over F<sub>2</sub>. Number walls are nicely explained (but no proof given) in <em>The Book of Numbers</em> by John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy.
</li>
<li> Also the <a href="https://github.com/clgravel/hankel_determinants_and_finding_linear_subsequences">first repository</a> that I made is related to the computation of the determinants of Hankel matrices. The code is bit messy, and I will leave it this way just to breathe life into my <a href="htps://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-68869-1_10">first work</a> on the topic.
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Properties of families of permutations that are extensions of non-linear small (random or pseudo-random) functions as in this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219498823500512">paper</a> and to some extent this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219498823500512">paper</a>. 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The repository on <a href="https://github.com/clgravel/optimal_randomness_extraction">randomness extraction</a> is nothing else than having fun to code the idea from Yuval Peres on iterating the von Neumann extractor to reach the Shannon bound.
</li>
</ul>
